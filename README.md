# Java Compiler

This project is a simplified Java compiler developed using **Flex** and **Bison** in **C**. It performs lexical and syntax analysis, builds and manages a symbol table, and parses a subset of Java-like code including classes, methods, expressions, control structures, and exception handling.

It also handles **semantic analysis**, generates **quadruples**, performs **basic optimizations**, and produces **object code**.
